# NPS HSR Grad 2017

Redeployed to [https://nps-hsr-grad-2017.netlify.com/](https://nps-hsr-grad-2017.netlify.com/)

This solution is actually an event management solution to issue custom qr codes as invites to each individual user and have an app to scan them in on entry to the event.

The solution has an web interface and an Android App, the App works to scan the qr codes, while the server sends the custom emailed invites and validates the qr codes


## Why I made this

This is one of those apps, I made because I was lazy to manually have an excel sheet and check of students coming to our high school prom, which had tickets which not the entire class bought, and hence this solution was created.

It was also a great learning opportunity in terms of App development, as my first attempt at making an App


## Repurposed 

This solution was migrate to node from php, adding custom image qr code generation and was used for [Oak Codefest](http://codefest.oakridge.in) for all participants. The repository migrated from just mainted by me, to the [Oak Codefest Team](https://github.com/oakblr) and is mainted at [Codefest Emailer](https://github.com/oakblr/Codefest-Emailer)
